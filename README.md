## Harry Hibbins

I am a quick learning, hardworking and upbeat individual, In the summer of 2022 I graduated with
a First-Class Honours degree in BSc. Games Technology. Since then, I have decided to apply my
coding knowledge down more of a software engineering route, rather than game development. I
graduated the Makers Bootcamp on February 10th, and I thoroughly enjoyed tailoring my skills to
this new path.
