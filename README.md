## Harry Hibbins

I am a quick learning, hardworking and upbeat individual, I recently graduated with a First-Class Honours
degree in BSc. Games Technology. Throughout my life I have proved to myself that I can work effectively as
part of a team and on my own, whether in a work environment or in sport. I am positive minded and enjoy
pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone.
I have always been surrounded by technology and at a young age acquired a keen interest in developing my
own games. Since then, I have become an adept programmer and am knowledgeable in various areas of
game development. I love the idea that I can be a piece of the puzzle that provides people with countless
hours of entertainment, just like I have experienced.
