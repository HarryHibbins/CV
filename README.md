## Harry Hibbins

I am a fast learning, hardworking and enthusiastic  **Full Stack Developer**. In the summer of 2022, I graduated
with a **First-Class Honours degree** in BSc. Games Technology. Since then, I have discovered a true passion for
software engineering, rather than game development. Specifically in the tech for good field. I recently graduated
the Makers software development bootcamp and I thoroughly enjoyed tailoring my skills to this new path. I’m
now looking for a role in which I can make a difference with my code.  

### Tech stacks:
JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Jest, Cypress.  
Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec.  
C#, Unity.  
C++, Unreal, DirectX.  
Swift, Xcode.   
HTML, CSS.  
SQL, PostgreSQL, TablePlus.  
Git, GitHub, Firebase.

## Skills

#### **Fast learner**
My time at Makers and University have taught me to learn efficiently. I can pick up new languages and technologies and be able to contribute to a project that I am not always familiar with. I learn by doing, I find that after a short period of research I like to get stuck in with a technology to figure out how it works. Once I am familiar with the basics I can further this with extended research through documentation or videos, which I find particularly useful.   

#### **Excellent communicator**
Whether it has been group projects, providing customer service, or in sport. I have always been able to quickly and effectively communicate with people to reach a solution that the team is happy with. This was evident in my final project at Makers where I assumed a leadership role. Some of my responsibilities  were handling the assigning of tasks, leading stand-ups and retros, or planning systems for the project. 

#### **Effective timekeeping skills and adaptability** 
Whilst studying at university I consistently had multiple large projects on the go at one given time, often using different technologies. I was able to manage my time successfully. Some techniques I used to achieve  this were using a pomodoro timer to stay focused, and a kanban board to organise each project. This in tandem with my determination to achieve the best results possible led me to achieve high grades across all modules.   


## Experience

#### _Makers, November 2022 – February 2023_  
The Makers bootcamp has given me invaluable experience and practice in many aspects of software development.
Tech used:
• Ruby, JavaScript, React, Jest, RSpec, Sinatra, Cypress, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.   
• Pair programming with new people each day, developing adaptability and flexibility.   
• Agile workflow to effectively deliver an MVP and iterating on it each sprint to reach a new release.   
• Actively seeking out feedback from an acting client, ensuring that the final version meets their requirements.   
• TDD in conjunction with mocking to create effective unit and integration tests. Leading to robust and easy to maintain code.    
• OOP and SOLID principles to allow any team member to adjust or extend the code.   
• Emotional intelligence training in a tech environment, improving my feedback empathy and teamwork skills.   
• Backend solutions for querying databases, managing security and handling data.   
Incorporating this with frontend code to present an intuitive page to a user and allow them to interact with it seamlessly.   
• GitHub pull requests and version control to meet project standards and manage handle large group projects.   


#### _The University of The West of England, September 2018 – June 2022_
Being a fast learner, I quickly became familiar with the basics of coding. My experience throughout the 4 years of intensive coding
and project management developed my skills to an advanced level.   
Tech used:   
• C#, C++, Unity, Unreal, DirectX.      
• Machine Learning to create an Automated testing system for a platformer game.   
• Developed Agile skills through a group project involving the whole cohort of 40+ people.
• Tech for good dissertation project that explored the possible health benefits of playing puzzle games for rehabilitation.     
• OOP principles to create games with hundreds of objects working simultaneously.   
• Networking to create multiplayer games that update objects for both players in real time.   
• GitHub to handle version control in both solo and group projects.   
• Optimisation system that used JSON to store world data and only load objects that the player could see.   
• Procedural generation to dynamically generate a unique map for each play session.    
• Debugging complex problems involving difficult mathematical equations.   
• Managing time and being flexible to deliver high quality projects using different technologies with tight deadlines daily.   
 
I am proud to be on the Dean’s List for consistently achieving higher than 70% in all modules in the academic year 2019/2020.   

#### _JD Sales Assistant July 2019 – November 2019_
My time as a sales assistant taught me many lessons that are relevant to everyday life.    
Most notable takeaways:   
• Effective communication with customers to ensure I could provide them with a satisfactory service.   
• Meeting targets set by managing staff, creating a good relationship with my superiors and working to their expectations.   
• Teamwork with my colleagues to deal with large quantities of customers at once.   
• Organisation to keep the stockroom operational ensuring there were no delays in providing customers a service.   


## Hobbies and Interests
• Keeping fit by playing sports, My favourite is football for fun or tennis to be more competitive.   
• Playing games and working out how I systems have been made and how they could be improved. Most recently I was amazed by God of War Ragnarok's combat system.   
• Attending live music with friends. The best I've ever seen was Eminem!
