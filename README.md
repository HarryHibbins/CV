## Harry Hibbins

I am a quick learning, hardworking and upbeat individual, In the summer of 2022 I graduated with
a First-Class Honours degree in BSc. Games Technology. Since then, I have decided to apply my
coding knowledge down more of a software engineering route, rather than game development. I
graduated the Makers Bootcamp on February 10th, and I thoroughly enjoyed tailoring my skills to
this new path.

## Experiences

_Makers November 2022 – February 2023_
The Makers bootcamp has enabled me to become an adept programmer by practicing
SOLID principles and utilising countless programming techniques such as TDD. Importantly
Makers has enabled me to find a passion for developing software that can solve real world
problems.
Key experiences
• Utilising pair programming with new people each day and regularly swapping the
driver/navigator roles to keep code quality up.
• Working using an Agile workflow in various group projects to effectively deliver an
MVP and iterating on it on each sprint to reach a new release.
• Developing code with requirements set by an acting client, communicating with them
to gain a better understanding of what they want the software to do.
• Practicing Test Driven Development to increase the robustness of code, mocking
objects to create effective unit tests.
• Using OOP and SOLID principles to improve the quality of code and to make it easier
to refactor and revisit.
• Experience using Ruby, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
• Experience creating my own backend solutions for querying databases, managing
security and handling data. Incorporating this with frontend code to present a page
to a user and allow them to interact with it.
• Using GitHub Pull requests effectively to ensure code quality is maintained and
merging code without issues.
• Reviewing other group member’s code to ensure the project is sticking to
conventions and best practice. Also gaining an understanding of how different
systems work.
• Using different debugging techniques to discover what is causing unexpected
behaviour effectively and quickly coming up with a solution.
• Having my code reviewed by a team of experienced programmers to improve my
design process and technical ability.
• I have learnt how to learn, how to efficiently pick up new languages and technologies
and be able to contribute to a project that I am not always familiar with.


**The University of The West of England** (09/2018 – 06/2022)  
I graduated with a First-Class Honours degree in BSc. Games Technology. During my time at University, I
quickly came familiar with the basics of coding and went on to become an advanced programmer.
Key experiences
• Proficient using C# in the Unity game engine
• Experience using C++ in the Unreal game engine, and DirectX
• Using GitHub to handle version control in both solo and group projects.
• Completed a project that involved the whole cohort of 40+ people, this meant we had
to use Agile development effectively to stay on top of the project.
• Debugging complex problems involving difficult mathematical equations
• Optimising systems by improving the redundancy of code using SOLID principles or
by revisiting design
• I have been added to the Dean's List for consistently achieving higher than 70% in all
modules in the academic year 2019/2020
• Created a procedural generation system
• Developing an automated testing solution using Machine Learning.
• Managing time effectively to deliver high quality projects on time with tight deadlines
and being able to
