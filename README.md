## Harry Hibbins

I am a quick learning, hardworking and **Full Stack Developer**, In the summer of 2022 I graduated with
a First-Class Honours degree in BSc. Games Technology. Since then, I have decided to apply my
coding knowledge down more of a software engineering route, rather than game development. I
graduated the Makers Bootcamp on February 10th, and I thoroughly enjoyed tailoring my skills to
this new path.

## Tech stacks:
JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Jest, Cypress.  
Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec.  
C#, Unity.  
C++, Unreal, DirectX.  
HTML, CSS.  
SQL, PostgreSQL, TablePlus.  
Git, GitHub, Firebase.

## Skills

### Fast learner
My time at Makers and University have taught me to learn efficiently. I can pick up new languages and technologies and be able to contribute to a project that I am not always familiar with. 

### Excellent communicator
Whether it has been group projects or providing good customer service, I have been able to quickly and effectively communicate with people to reach a solution that everyone is happy with.

### Effective timekeeping skills and adaptabilty 
Whislt studying at university I always had multiple large projects on the go at one given time, often using different technologies. I was able to manage my time successfully to enable myself to still acheive high grades across all modules. 


## Experience

#### _Makers, November 2022 – February 2023_  
The Makers bootcamp has enabled me to become an adept programmer by practicing OOP and SOLID principles and utilising vaulable programming techniques such as TDD and CI/CD. Importantly Makers has enabled me to find a passion for developing software that can solve real world problems.  

• Working using an Agile workflow in various group projects to effectively deliver an MVP and iterating on it on each sprint to reach a new release.  
• Developing code with requirements set by an acting client, communicating with them to gain a better understanding of what they want the software to do.  
• Practicing Test Driven Development to increase the robustness of code, mocking objects to create effective unit tests.   
• Utilising pair programming with new people each day and regularly swapping the driver/navigator roles to keep code quality up.  
• Experience creating my own backend solutions for querying databases, managing security and handling data. Incorporating this with frontend code to present a page to a user and allow them to interact with it.  
• Model View Controller design pattern.
• Using GitHub Pull requests effectively to ensure code quality is maintained and merging code without issues. Also reviewing other group member’s code to gain an understanding of how other systems in the project work.  
• Having my code reviewed by a team of experienced programmers to improve my design process and technical ability.   


#### _The University of The West of England, September 2018 – June 2022_
I graduated with a First-Class Honours degree in BSc. Games Technology. During my time at University, I quickly came familiar with the basics of coding and went on to become an advanced programmer. My Dissertation project (1st) looked into the postive health benefits video games can have.

• Using GitHub to handle version control in both solo and group projects.  
• Completed a project that involved the whole cohort of 40+ people, this meant we had to use Agile development effectively to stay on top of the project.  
• Optimising systems by improving the redundancy of code using SOLID principles or by revisiting design.  
• Experience with utilising procedural generation to change the experience for a player each time they play.  
• Developing an automated testing solution using Machine Learning.  


## Hobbies and Interests
• Keeping fit by playing sports, primarily football and tennis.   
• Playing games and working out how I systems have been made and how they could be improved.    
• Attending live music with friends.   
• Developing my own projects.
